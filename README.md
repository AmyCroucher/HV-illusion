# Horizontal-Vertical Illusion
Here's a simple page I made to demonstrate the Horizontal-Vertical (or _T_) illusion. The Horizontal-Vertical illusion shows that we have a tendency to overestimate the length of the vertical line in a 'T' shape relative to the horizontal line.

I actually made this page for my psychology students to form the materials for their first lab experiment. I may add to it in future (by including new orientations and making the line draggable), but it'll do for now!
